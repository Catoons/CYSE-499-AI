**HW1: Implement a Python solver for ridge regression**

_Course Description
Fall 2025

This course introduces the core concepts of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in cybersecurity engineering. Students will explore fundamental methods in ML, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and gain practical experience in developing and implementing traditional ML and modern AI models to solve real cybersecurity engineering problems, such as intrusion detection and phishing prediction. The course also touches topics that interplay ML and CYSE, such as data and model security, adversarial attacks and defenses, and ethical, safety, and privacy considerations in AI systems. Prerequisites include linear algebra, probability, and statistics. Python programming will be involved in most assignments and course projects.

Class Objectives:   

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

Comprehend the principles and state-of-the-art techniques of ML and AL, including generative AI and Foundation Models.
Develop complete AI training and evaluation frameworks using standard programming frameworks.
Formulate and solve real cybersecurity engineering problems by applying AI tools.
Identify potential AI vulnerabilities such as hallucination, jailbreaks, backdoor attacks, and understand their countermeasures.
Communicate AI concepts, design methodologies, and application results to both technical and non-technical audiences.
Assess the moral and societal implications of AI in cybersecurity engineering._
